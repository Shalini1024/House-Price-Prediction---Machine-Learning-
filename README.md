# House-Price-Prediction---Machine-Learning-

Developed a machine learning model to predict housing prices using features like rooms, square footage, and property type. Performed data cleaning, binning, and label encoding. Compared algorithms including Linear Regression.

This project focuses on predicting housing prices based on key property features such as the number of rooms, total square footage, BHK/RK type, and property listing type (owner or dealer). The objective was to explore how various machine learning algorithms perform on real estate data and identify the most accurate model for price prediction.

Through extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing, missing values were handled, scaling and binning techniques were applied, and categorical variables were encoded for model readiness. 
Multiple models — including Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree — were trained and evaluated for performance accuracy.

Among these, KNN and Decision Tree models achieved the highest accuracy (63% and 64% respectively), making them the most effective algorithms for this dataset. This project demonstrates practical application of data transformation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling to solve real-world pricing problems.
